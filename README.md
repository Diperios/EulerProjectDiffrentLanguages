# EulerProjectDiffrentLanguages

this project contains code written in different programming languages to solve problems from Project Euler. 

The purpose of this project is to learn new programming languages and test my developing skills in solving problems from Project Euler using those languages. the idea is that by implementing solutions in different languages, I as the developer, can gain a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each language and improve their problem-solving skills.
